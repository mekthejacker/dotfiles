xkbcomp appends settings to already existing set just as setxkbmap,
  so it’s necessary to either rewrite all the changing settings,
  or clean the X server from xkb alternations. Which means
  - running
      setxkbmap -layout us -option -print | xkbcomp - $DISPLAY
    if the settings were usual setxkbmap;
  - restarting X server otherwise.
  Using Xephyr is a nice alternative to the latter.
