man xkbcomp

Export current layout to file:
  xkbcomp -xkb :0 ./xkbcomp_new.xkb
Reexport from xkb to xkm format (text → binary)
  xkbcomp -xkm ./xkbcomp.xkb ./xkbcomp.xkm
Import layout from file
  xkbcomp ./xkbcomp.xkm :0

The list of all character names can be found with
  find /usr/include/X11 -name keysymdef.h

// This type of comment works in .xkb files
some code // this way, too

xkbcomp appends settings to already existing set just as setxkbmap,
  so it’s necessary to either rewrite all the changing settings,
  or clean the X server from xkb alternations. Which means
  - running
      setxkbmap -layout us -option -print | xkbcomp - $DISPLAY
    if the settings were usual setxkbmap;
  - restarting X server otherwise.
  Using Xephyr is a nice alternative to the latter.
